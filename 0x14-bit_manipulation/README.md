# Bit Manipulations

---
How the works around bit manipulations and binary manipulations are carried out!!.
---

* Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

	* Prototype: unsigned int binary-to-uint(const char *b);

* Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

	* Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

* Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

	* Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);

* Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

	* Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

* Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

	* Prototype: int clear_ bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

* Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

	* Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
